## BUDGET NEEDED FOR REMEDIATION

### Immediate Response (24-48 hours): **$75,000 - $100,000**
- Incident Response Team (2 senior engineers): $40,000
- Security Vendor Emergency Support: $25,000
- AWS Guard Duty/Security Hub upgrades: $10,000
- Emergency WAF/DDoS Protection: $15,000

### Recovery & Hardening (1-2 weeks): **$150,000 - $200,000**
- Security Architecture Review: $50,000
- Identity & Access Management Overhaul: $40,000
- Data Loss Assessment & Recovery: $35,000
- Security Tool Implementation: $25,000
- Training & Documentation: $15,000

### **Total Budget Required: $225,000 - $300,000**

---

## RISK IF WE DO NOTHING

### Next 24 Hours:
- **Complete data exfiltration** of all S3 buckets
- **Total account takeover** via escalated IAM privileges
- **Massive AWS bill** from cryptomining (est. $50K-100K/day)
- **Regulatory violations** from data breach disclosure requirements

### Next 7 Days:
- **Ransomware deployment** likely (typical progression)
- **Supply chain attacks** on your customers
- **Complete infrastructure compromise**
- **Unrecoverable data loss**

### Business Impact:
- **Customer Trust:** Irreparable damage
- **Regulatory Fines:** $1M-50M (depending on data types)
- **Legal Liability:** Class action lawsuits likely
- **Recovery Time:** 3-6 months minimum
- **Revenue Loss:** 20-40% annual revenue impact

## RECOMMENDATION

This is a **DEFCON 1** situation. Activate your incident response plan immediately. This sophisticated attack shows clear signs of:

1. **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** characteristics
2. **Multi-stage attack** with persistence mechanisms
3. **Professional cybercriminal** or nation-state activity

**Do NOT attempt to handle this internally unless you have a dedicated security team.** Engage professional incident response services IMMEDIATELY.
