# ðŸš¨ SECURITY INCIDENT SUMMARY: CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING DETECTION

**Incident ID**: INC-2025-0831-001  
**Date/Time**: August 31, 2025 at 11:46:45 UTC  
**Severity**: **HIGH (8/10)**  
**Status**: ðŸ”´ **ACTIVE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A critical security incident has been detected involving EC2 instance **i-99999999**, which appears to be compromised and potentially being used for unauthorized cryptocurrency mining operations. The instance queried Bitcoin-related domain names, indicating possible cryptomining malware infection or unauthorized mining software installation.

## INCIDENT DETAILS

### Primary Finding
- **Finding Type**: CryptoCurrency:EC2/BitcoinTool.B!DNS
- **Finding ID**: d561ac4fb20b4a17815ad02080be9079
- **Description**: The EC2 instance queried a domain name associated with Bitcoin-related activity
- **First Detected**: August 31, 2025 at 11:46:45 UTC
- **Threat Action**: DNS_REQUEST to cryptocurrency-related domains

### Affected Resource
- **Instance ID**: i-99999999
- **Instance Type**: p2.xlarge (GPU-optimized instance)
- **Region**: [To be determined]
- **Tags**: Multiple GeneratedFinding tags present

### Concurrent Security Events
Multiple security incidents occurred simultaneously with the cryptocurrency mining detection, suggesting a coordinated compromise:

1. **Malicious IP Communication** (Severity: 5)
   - Instance communicating with IP addresses on custom threat lists
   
2. **Trojan Activity** (Severity: 5)
   - Communication with blackholed IP addresses (known C&C servers)
   
3. **Active Reconnaissance** (Severity: 2)
   - Unprotected ports being probed
   
4. **SSH Brute Force Attack** (Severity: 2)
   - Source IP: 198.51.100.0 attempting SSH authentication

---

## THREAT ANALYSIS

### Attack Pattern
The combination of findings suggests a multi-stage attack:
1. **Initial Compromise**: Likely through SSH brute force or exploited vulnerability
2. **Malware Installation**: Cryptocurrency mining software deployed
3. **Command & Control**: Established communication with external C&C servers
4. **Mining Operations**: Active Bitcoin/cryptocurrency mining using GPU resources

### Risk Assessment
- **Data Exfiltration Risk**: Medium - Focus appears to be resource hijacking
- **Lateral Movement Risk**: High - Compromised instance could be used as pivot point
- **Financial Impact**: High - p2.xlarge instances cost ~$0.90/hour; unauthorized mining
- **Reputation Risk**: Medium - Resources being used for illicit activities

## IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ACTIONS

### ðŸ”´ Priority 1 - Containment (Within 15 minutes)
1. **ISOLATE the instance immediately**
   - Modify security group to block all inbound/outbound traffic except management access
   - Command: `aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id i-99999999 --groups sg-isolation`

2. **Create forensic snapshot**
   - Snapshot the EBS volumes before any changes
   - Command: `aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id [volume-id] --description "Incident-INC-2025-0831-001"`

3. **Stop the instance** (if business permits)
   - Command: `aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-99999999`

### ðŸŸ¡ Priority 2 - Investigation (Within 1 hour)
1. **Collect Evidence**
   - Pull CloudTrail logs for last 48 hours
   - Retrieve VPC Flow Logs
   - Capture instance metadata and running processes

2. **Check for persistence mechanisms**
   - Review user data scripts
   - Check for modified AMIs
   - Investigate IAM role attachments

3. **Scope assessment**
   - Check if other instances show similar indicators
   - Review billing for unexpected compute usage spikes

### ðŸŸ¢ Priority 3 - Recovery (Within 4 hours)
1. **Clean or rebuild**
   - Preferred: Launch new instance from clean AMI
   - Alternative: Remove mining software and malware

2. **Strengthen security**
   - Rotate all credentials
   - Update security groups with strict rules
   - Enable GuardDuty automated responses

3. **Monitor closely**
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for CPU/GPU usage
   - Enable detailed monitoring
   - Configure SNS alerts for future GuardDuty findings

## REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Short-term (24-48 hours)
- Implement IP allowlisting for SSH access
- Enable AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for secure access
- Deploy AWS WAF rules to block cryptocurrency mining pools
- Review and revoke unnecessary IAM permissions

### Long-term (1-2 weeks)
- Implement CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
- Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution
- Establish automated incident response playbooks
- Conduct security awareness training on cryptocurrency mining threats

---

## INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE (IoCs)

### Network Indicators
- DNS queries to Bitcoin/cryptocurrency domains
- Connections to blackholed IP addresses
- Communication with custom threat list IPs
- SSH brute force from 198.51.100.0

### System Indicators
- High GPU/CPU utilization on p2.xlarge instance
- Suspicious DNS resolution patterns
- Potential cryptocurrency mining processes

---

## LESSONS LEARNED OPPORTUNITIES

1. **Detection Gap**: All findings triggered simultaneously - consider earlier detection mechanisms
2. **Instance Type Risk**: GPU instances (p2.xlarge) are prime targets for cryptominers
3. **Access Control**: SSH brute force suggests weak access controls
4. **Response Time**: Need automated response to high-severity findings
